# React and Firebase Chat App

This is the project code for my [React and Firebase chatroom app tutorial](https://www.zachsnoek.com/blog/how-to-build-chatroom-app-react-firebase). The app uses React for the frontend, Firestore for real-time messaging, and Firebase Authentication for Google authentication.

Some specific React concepts this tutorial teaches are:

* Storing global context with the Context API
* Creating custom hooks for consuming context and synchronizing with external data
* Using unauthenticated and authenticated app components based on the user's authentication state

## Quick start

1. Obtain your Firebase configuration following [these steps](https://www.zachsnoek.com/blog/how-to-build-chatroom-app-react-firebase#set-up-the-firebase-project-and-react-app)
2. Add your Firebase configuration to `src/services/firebase.js`
3. Run `yarn && yarn start`
